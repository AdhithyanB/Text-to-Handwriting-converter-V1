Machine Learning Pipeline Steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Clean and normalize input data
   - Handle missing values appropriately
   - Feature engineering and selection

2. Model Training and Validation
   - Split data into training/testing sets
   - Choose appropriate algorithms
   - Cross-validation for robustness

3. Performance Evaluation
   - Accuracy metrics calculation
   - Confusion matrix analysis
   - Model optimization techniques
