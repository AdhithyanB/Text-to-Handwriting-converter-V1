The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Formula: a² + b² = c²

This fundamental principle has applications in:
- Architecture and construction
- Navigation and GPS systems
- Computer graphics and game development
- Engineering calculations
